## Survive the shivering platforms...

My submission for the **Supercell** Solo One Day Game Jam challenge! The theme given for this jam was ```survive```—here's my doing:

In the game, your goal is to survive for **60** seconds by staying on the platforms until the timer runs out. If you fall, it’s game over. Hostile **skeletons** will try to knock you off, but you’re equipped with a powerful **lance**. Not just any **lance**—it’s sharp and can be thrown at incoming enemies to fend them off!

Be careful though! Jumping or throwing your **lance** will cause the platform to shatter, so think twice!
