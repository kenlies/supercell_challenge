## Survive the shivering platforms...

My submission for the **Supercell** Solo One Day Game Jam challenge! The theme given for this jam was ```survive```‚Äîhere's my doing:

In the game, your goal is to survive for **60** seconds by staying on the platforms until the timer runs out. If you fall, it‚Äôs game over. Hostile **skeletons** will try to knock you off, but you‚Äôre equipped with a powerful **lance**. Not just any **lance**‚Äîit‚Äôs sharp and can be thrown at incoming enemies to fend them off!

Be careful though! Jumping or throwing your **lance** will cause the platform to shatter, so think twice!

Oh, and I made the game work on mobile as well:

And the game features some **DOPE** beats btw!

## üî® To improve

There is some improvement to be had on code organization, because the timeframe for this project was only one day, I didn't really focus on that aspect much. I think I really achieved my vision with this one, the gameplay feels fun and the game plays quite well in my opinion. Although the movement by tilting the world is a bit questionable but ok.
